    ```
        Halaster - he's done it. The Gulthias tree bears fruit once again. His lackey's were trying to smuggle the poisoned fruit into the city. I stopped them, but one of them bit the apple and it's already begun to sprout. The blights will come for me any second now -- if they do, you'll have to find someone to stop him. He's our mistake, we're responsible for the lives he'll surely take. Goodbye, old friend.
