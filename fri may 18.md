        * haraven dardragon emerges, 1000 yard stare, mutters "She... she was an elf... but where the legs should be, it was all spider"
        * halaster sighs, looks over the party, asks for aid to check on his friend in the woods outside the city. the tab's on him if they agree.
            * made a friend in the underdark, helped him escape. makes sure not to let any guards hear.

### wilderness - beholder cave
* party emerges into from a copse of trees into a small clearing, maybe 40ft empty of trees
* party spots the cave entrance, secluded in a grove of trees, looks like an opening that was drilled into a hill.
* first fight - 1 goblin, 2-3 twig blights (25xp per player)
* large row of dead bushes on right hand side of the cave entrance
    * there is a goblin behind here who will attack w/ bow if anyone comes close
    * goblin's first turn he activates the twig blights
    * goblin will try to flee inside cave if he gets to 1/3rd health
    * will warn the blights inside if thats the case
* party needs to go inside
* winding S shaped path leading to a room at the end that contains several bookshelves, an alchemy table, a writing desk, golden trophy chalice, well lit with candles. might be a nice place to live if you were from the underdark
* at each turn of the path is a trap that was tripped by a goblin
  * 1st turn goblin that has been literally cut into cubes
  * 2nd turn 2 goblins that have clearly killed each other, one has his hand on a dagger that is still plunged under the chin of the other
* if goblin did not warn anyone, dead beholder face down on ground over what looks like a thick tangle of sprouted vines
* if goblin did warn then beholder is "floating" on vines with twig blights and goblin ready to attack
* second fight - 1 vine blight (wearing the corpse of the beholder friend), 2 twig blights, and 1 goblin if first fight went too easy (30xp per player)
* **beholder flavor**: _It floats before you, a bulbous body with a central, unblinking eye, and a large maw filled with daggerlike teeth. Smaller eyes, attached to wriggling stalks, sprout from the top of the orblike body._
* party should investigate the room, find journal with a hastily scrawled note to Halaster
    ```
        Halaster - he's done it. The Gulthias tree bears fruit once again.
        His lackey's were trying to smuggle the poisoned fruit into the city.
        I stopped them, but one of them bit the apple and it's already begun to sprout.
        The blights will come for me any second now -- if they do, you'll have to find someone to stop him.
        He's our mistake, we're responsible for the lives he'll surely take.
        Goodbye, old friend.
    ```
