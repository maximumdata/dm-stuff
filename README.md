# dm-stuff
a small react app i use while DM-ing dungeons and dragons. it generates random inns, random statues, and random NPC names. More features will be added as I translate my handwritten random arrays into code.

oh, i'm also using this to teach myself react, so it's very messy. `npm i` and then `npm start` to run it.
