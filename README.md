# dm-stuff

i _think_ this is going to be an express server with various tools i'll use while DMing.

### features
* controller to request a random statue from http://warpwalkers.com/2017/statuegenerator/

### ideas
* canvas app with a grid to draw on to build a map
* socket.io app to use the above grid to reveal specific pieces of the map as players explore it
